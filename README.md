# Equality between Objects

One of the critical tasks in data privacy in an ontology is hiding the identity of objects stored in the ontology. To realize this, we define the notion of the identity problem in ontologies written in a fragment of first-order logic, called description logic. In this problem, we ask whether two objects in a given ontology are equal or not with respect to the ontology.
